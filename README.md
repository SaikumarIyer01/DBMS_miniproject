# Hospital Management System

## Description-
We hope to overcome traditional hospital management challenges with this project. The existing system provided a paper-based solution for keeping patient and hospital staff OPD records, but it overburdens doctors, receptionists, and administrators. The main concerns were improper data storage, time waste in storage, retrieval, and patients' inability to grasp the prescription, among other things. Provide a separate user account for doctors and other employees to address these issues. Keeping each patient's data separate and easily tracking past visits.
   
 This project is built in Java and uses MYSQL as its backend, providing platform independence, great performance, and security. It's a web application that primarily makes use of the SpringMVC and Hibernate frameworks.

It has several improved capabilities, such as an easy interface for adding and removing personnel, as well as a PDF of the prescription. As a result, the doctor's requirement to manually write and sign is reduced.

## Technologies Used-

  - Bootstrap
  - JavaScript
  
### 2. Back end Technologies:
  - SpringMVC 
  - Hibernate
  
### 3. Database:
  - MySQL
  
### 4. Project management tool:
  - Maven
  
### 5. Webserver:
  - Apache Tomcat
  

## Issues that proposed system overcomes-
   - It is digital system rather than paper based.
   - Inappropriate data keeping (receptionist used register for patients entry and doctor used prescription pad).
   - Time wastage in data storage and retrieval.
   - Human error possibility in maintainance.
   - Patient's were unable to understand prescriptions due to handwriting issue.
   - Durability issues (data may lost if prescriptions goes missing).


## Features-
  1. Doctor module:
      - Seperate accounts for doctors
      - Each patients previous visits history is easily to access.
      - Doctor can generate prescription and it will be automatically sent to receptionist.
      - Doctor can remove patient from OPD queue.
      
  2. Receptionist module:
      - Register/add new patient's info.
      - Modify patients personal details
      - Search existing patient by name/ mobile no./ PID/ aadhar no.
      - Remove patient from OPD queue.
      - Take print of prescriptions.
      
  3. Administrator module:
      - Add new employee for following roles,
                      i) Doctor
                     ii) Receptionist
                    iii) Admin (another one)
      - Remove/edit existing employee. 
      - Displays currently active employees in system.
      
  4. Password Encryption:
      - *_Bcrypt Encoding_* is used for password encryption. Bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res. It is based on the Blowfish cipher. Bcrypt uses adaptive hash algorithm to store password. BCrypt internally generates a random salt while encoding passwords and hence it is obvious to get different encoded results for the same string. But one common thing is that everytime it generates a String of length 60.
